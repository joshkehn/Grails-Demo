Controller
------------
1. 	Receive file, newFileName, fileType
	a. How do we process uploaded file in Grails?
		
2.	Process file - use processedFileContents = FileProcessor.processFile(file,fileType)

3.	Scrub file - use scrubbedFileContents = Scrubber.scrub(processedFileContents,fileType)

4.	Save file - use FileProcessor.saveReadyFile(scrubbedFileContents, newFileName)	

5.	Get list of ready files' URLs, use String[] urls = FileProcessor.getReadyFiles().	
	
6.	Return the urls to the main view
	a. How does the view/controller interaction work in Grails?
	b. How do we spin Controller steps 2 - 4 as a separate thread? Suggestion: Grails BackgroundThread Plugin
	
	
FileProcessor
-------------
methods:
1.	getReadyFilesUrls()
	a) Get list of ready files from the ready-files directory
	b) convert their names to URLs to be served on the front-end
	c) Return the URLs
	
	questions:
	a. How does Grails serve text files from dirs?
		A: GSP tag <g:createLinkTo>
			<a class="home" href="${createLinkTo(dir:'', file:'')}">Home</a>
	
2.	saveReadyFile(FileContents, name)
	a) Create new file with the passed name in the ready-files directory
	b) Write to the new file the FileContents lines
	
	questions:
	a. How does Grails do File IO?	
	b. How do we monitor the processing progress and update the front end progress-bar with the progress?
	
3.	processFile(FileContents,fileType)
	a) 	If fileType = CSV
	b) 		remove commas from FileContents strings
	c)	Else
	d)		do nothing
	e)	Return the String array representing the processed file contents
	

Scrubber
--------
methods:
1.	scrub(FileContents, fileType)
	a)	Get scrub list: Array<ScrubItem> scrubList = get scrub list from DB
	b)	If fileType = md5
	c)		subtract scrubList from FileContents based on md5 field of scrubList
	d)	Else
	e)		subtract scrubList from FileContents based on email field of scrubList
	f)	Return the resulting Contents(Array<String>)
	
	questions:
	a. Does Groovy/Grails provide a mechanism for easy subtraction of sets? If not, use beanutils
